# DaFT : Embedded C

So you've decided to learn the world of Embedded C! A brave move, well hopefully this will be able to teach you something and get you started on that journey.

## What does this cover?

The main aim of this course is to build you up to be confident at tackling problems that require you to either modify someone elses code or to write your own thing from scratch!!! But the main focus is being given missions and developing solutions. The Starter Series is intended as exactly that, a starting point for those who are completely new to C or want a refresher on certain topics.

## Books

The following books may also be useful when trying to follow this material.

- [K&R C Book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/C-Programming-Language-2nd/dp/0131103628) - From the creators of C.
- [D&D C Book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Program-Studies-Applications-Programming-dp-1292437073/dp/1292437073/ref=dp_ob_title_bk) - From some people who are just good at writing text books.

## Tools

We will be using a handful of development kits with this material. Ultimately the course could be run on any of them, but if you can try to at least pick up some kits from multiple vendors at least so that you can compare the difference between them.

### ST Microelectronics Dev Kits

- [NUCLEO-C031C6](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-c031c6.html) - An ARM Cortex M0+ MCU, from their cheap C0 series.
- [NUCLEO-G0B1RE](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-g0b1re.html) - Another M0+, bit more memory that the C0 series.
- [NUCLEO-G491RE](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-g491re.html) - An ARM Cortex M4, more power more stuff!
- [NUCLEO-L432KC](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-l432kc.html) - Another M4 core, from the range of devices that are aimed at low power
- [NUCLEO-F767ZI](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f767zi.html) - ARM Cortex M7 part this time, powerful enough to take over the world! (maybe)
- [NUCLEO-H755ZI-Q](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-h755zi-q.html) - A Dual Core M7 and M4 part

### NXP Dev Kits

TBD - (LPC55 Series)

### Microchip Dev Kits

TBD - SAMD20/21, SAMC range
